I have implemented clustering algorithm. The codes  are types run forever. 
Since I have used while loops, it is required to stop the execution by pausing.

 Mobile WSN using kmean clustering
   (i). Run the file wsn_kmean.m. It just gives a basic simulation without any power calculations.

Note:
For the implementation of the LEACH algorithm I have used the code from mathworks.com website(https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/48162-leach-low-energy-adaptive-clustering-hierarchy-protocol).
